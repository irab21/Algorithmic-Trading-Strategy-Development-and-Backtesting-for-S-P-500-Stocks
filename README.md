<b> Develop and evaluate a trading algorithm using statistical and machine learning models to optimize portfolio returns for S&P 500 stocks. Focus on strategy performance through backtesting, risk management, and alpha generation.</b>
Summary of Findings:
Strategy Performance:

The mean-reversion strategy (based on RSI) performed best during sideways markets, capturing gains from price fluctuations.
The Sharpe Ratio indicated the strategyâ€™s risk-adjusted returns, with higher values suggesting acceptable performance relative to risk.
Key Metrics:

Sharpe Ratio: Demonstrated the balance between returns and volatility.
Maximum Drawdown: Highlighted the largest portfolio decline during backtesting, providing insights into risk exposure.
Profitability:

Profitable trades were primarily driven by RSI signals during oversold (buy) and overbought (sell) conditions.
Limited profitability during strongly trending markets, where a trend-following strategy might perform better.
Risk Management:

Adding stop-losses and take-profits improved capital protection and reduced significant drawdowns.
Portfolio risk remained manageable, but additional diversification could lower volatility further.
Optimization Insights:

Tuning the RSI parameters (e.g., RSI period, low/high thresholds) significantly impacted the performance, with specific values yielding optimal returns.
Market Conditions:

The strategy performed well in low-volatility, range-bound markets, but underperformed in strongly trending environments (e.g., bull or bear runs).
Visualization:

The equity curve showed consistent gains during certain market conditions but revealed vulnerabilities during high-volatility periods.
